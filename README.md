# What it is?
My entry to the Theana Weekly Game Jam #15. It was created in 72 hours. 
Take control of the sorter in the middle of the screen and move it and rotate it to push the shapes to the best possible bucket. The better you sort, the more score you get. It is a quick but very challenging. Have Fun!
